# school_district_analysis
### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to assist Maria in proving or disproving academic dishonesty. We are mainly focusing on the Freshman class in this analysis, where some grades seem to be altered.

### Analysis
There were not much changes to the results, even with the changes we made Thomas High is still one of the top rated schools. There was less than a percentage change to the dataset, so I would not think that there is any academic dishonesty.
